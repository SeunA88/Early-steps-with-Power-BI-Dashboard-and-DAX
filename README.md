## Introduction

Data visualization is an important aspect in Power BI that enhances understanding of data, communication of insights, and decision-making based on generated insights; by representing data graphically in visually appealing and easily understandable manner. 

In this task, an interactive dashboard by combining multiple visualizations with each telling its own story. The data used for this dashboard creation is Bank deposit dataset(). It basically contains information about bank depositors/clients such as name, age, marital status, age, credit history, loan history as well as other inportant information. Also, the  data details the diffrent bank campaigns carried alongside their outcomes with each depositors/clients.

## Creating the Dashboard

In creating the dashboard, some data were selected to aid the understandng of the data and to bring out some insights from the data. The following data were focussed on and visualised in the dashboard. 

- Average age of the bank clients/depositors
- Average yearly balance of the bank clients/depositors
- Total number of subscribed/target clients
- Total campaign by job type
- Total number of poutcome by education
- Total number of subscribed/target clients by credit in default
- Total number of subscribed/target clients by marital status
- Total number of subscribed/target clients by campaign and
- Average balance by subscribed/target clients

#### Please find below the dashboard created.

#### In the following task, Data Analysis Expressions (DAX), which is designed to perform calculations, create custom measures, and manipulate data, was used to perform the following calculations from the same data ().

1). A measure for the ‘Average age of depositors’

2). A new column named ‘Age band’ containing the following;
    ‘Young’ for ages below 30
     ‘Mid-aged’ for ages between 30 and 50
     ‘Old’ for ages above 50
     
3). A measure calculating the total balance for:
    Job: Technician
    Marital: Single and Married
    
4). A measure to get the number of depositors on Loan


#### The following DAX was used to answer the questions above.

- Average age of depositors = AVERAGE('bank-full'[Age])

- Age Band = IF('bank-full'[Age]<30, "Young", IF('bank-full'[Age] < 50, "Mid age", IF('bank-full'[Age]>50, "Old")))
  
- Total Balance (Technician) = CALCULATE(SUM('bank-full'[Balance]),'bank-full'[Job]="technician")
 
- Total Balance (Married) = CALCULATE(SUM('bank-full'[Balance]), ('bank-full'[Marital status] = "married"))

- Total Balance (Single) = CALCULATE(SUM('bank-full'[Balance]), 'bank-full'[Marital status] = "single")

- Total Balance (Single & Married) = CALCULATE([Total Balance (Married)] + [Total Balance (Single)])
  
  Alternatively, a single calculated measure can be used, see below:
  
- Total Balance (Single and Married) = CALCULATE(SUM('bank-full'[Balance]),('bank-full'[Marital status] = "single") + ('bank-full'[Marital status] = "married"))

- Number of Depositors on loan = CALCULATE(COUNT('bank-full'[Loan]), 'bank-full'[Loan] = "yes")
  

  #### The results of each calculation is shown in the Report view below:
